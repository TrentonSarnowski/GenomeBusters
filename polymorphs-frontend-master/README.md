# Polymorphs Frontend

This repository contains the code for the frontend of the GeneScape Viewer. The GeneScape viewer was a senior design project (2016-2017) with the goal of processing and/or identifying genes within given gene files. Furthermore, we tried to implement the viewer with a Google Maps "look and feel". To do this, we heavily relied on ReactJS and D3 for rendering the website. This project currently only processes genbank files (preset or uploaded) fetches the results from the [GeneScape API](https://github.com/euclideansphere/polymorphs).

The project is implemented in React, and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## Getting Started

You can get started with these three steps.

```
git clone git@github.com:jakerobers/polymorphs-frontend.git && cd polymorphs-frontend

If you need to fetch the data from the API, please read the [instructions](https://github.com/euclideansphere/polymorphs/blob/master/README.md) for setting up the server.
