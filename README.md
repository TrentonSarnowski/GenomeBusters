# GenomeBusters

Note: the following came from Big Bacillus readme.

## Polymorphs GeneViewer

This project is a continuation of the __Polymorph GeneViewer__ application, a
2017 senior design project for the BioMolecular Engineer Department at the
_Milwaukee School of Engineering_. Since the previous team took down their
repositories, the project had to be re-uploaded for continued improvements.

## Setup instructions

This project is setup to use vagrant for ease of maintenance and installation.
A manual installation can be completed as well if one wishes to run the project
on the local machine (such as on production servers).

### Vagrant Setup

This section assumes you have the following items installed on your machine:
__git, vagrant__

1. Ensure the system installation requirements listed above are met.
2. Setup the virtual machine by running ```vagrant up --provision```
3. Start all required servers by running ```.\start-all.cmd``` on the host
   machine.
4. Navigate to the website by going to ```localhost:3000/``` in a browser.

### Manual Setup
